My first website Kappa

On this website ive tried, for the first time, to create a webpage/homepage based on html with css. While not perfect, i, for the first time, feel like i understand what programming a website feels like.
Ive added a hompage with basic informations about me (and some of my current songs).
My curriculum only states my latest diploma, my noteable abilities and one example of my work.
Lastly, ive gathered all the information we learned through our uni classes - or at least those i felt like they were important.
There is also the my-class section - a left over from our practical exercise.

While i used the exercise website made available during classes as refrence, i wanted to recreat the whole process on my own, thus all the files (except for the table.css and my-class files) were created by me
and the help of others.
